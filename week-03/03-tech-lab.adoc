= Lab 03 (Technical) Deploying an application with Docker

_This is still an early stage lab. All that is required is that you do your best and present errors to the instructor and your classmates._

Learning objectives for this lab:

* Gain basic Docker skills using GCP
** Running pre-existing Docker containers
** Creating a Docker container with a simple application in it
* Moving your application to Docker

== Priority #1: Destroy all Google VMs. 
You should never leave anything running on Google. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/compute and make sure all VMs are destroyed, manually if necessary. 

Get in the habit of running `terraform destroy -auto-approve` at the end of every session. You only should be creating VMs (and networks, firewalls, etc) via Terraform templates. 

== Basic Docker skills

Prerequisite: In-class discussion of port mapping. 

NOTE: You can run most of tutorial within the Google Cloud Shell. The one thing you can't do there is access a running container from an external Web browser, so to see results in Chrome for example you *must* spin up a VM. However, you can validate that a Web server is functioning locally with the `curl` command, which is a very useful tool you will find yourself relying on. 

* Study https://cloud.google.com/containers/.

* Run https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-docker[Quickstart for Docker^]
** You do *not* need to run and initialize the Cloud SDK unless you intend to operate Google Cloud from your personal laptop. It is already installed on the Google Cloud Shell. 

* Review https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/ 

* Run https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/docker-compose-on-container-optimized-os - just that first page, do not continue with the further links at the end. 

* With those preliminaires out of the way, noting any necessary adaptations, run the full Docker tutorial https://docker-curriculum.com/. In particular, you do not need to install Docker. Use the Google Command Shell natively. 

** You can even navigate to a web page. When you first run your container, the command and its result should look like this: 


`<userid>:docker-tutorial$ docker run -p 8080:5000 charlestbetz/catnip`

 `* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

If you click on the suggested link, you will get an error indicating the wrong port.

Try changing the URL... 

** We are using Google, not Amazon. Do the beginning of the Amazon section where it describes pushing to the Docker hub. Stop at Elastic Beanstalk.  

** Then, create your own instance using `cos-cloud/cos-stable` and `fi-micro` and the `main.tf` file suggested below. Using what you have learned so far, log into the new VM and run your container from the Docker Hub. 

** Try pinging your new VM from a local command prompt. Are you able to do this right away? 

** Try accessing your website as the tutorial suggests. What issues might you be having with the address? Why? 

** Does the website seem to hang? Don't be impatient. Time how long it takes to display. 

** How might we make it faster? Think about this. (In class discussion.)

** Be sure to destroy. 

== Replatforming your system

* On your Github account, set up an empty repo with the name "YOUREMAIL-dock-tut" (YOUREMAIL is your 8 char email account), and clone it down to your ~/repos directory on Google Cloud Shell. 

* Configure a basic static webserver of your choice (either based on the webfsd ex)

* Move your images and html file over to your new repo. 

* Create an appropriate Dockerfile. Is the `ONBUILD` trigger useful? Review how the tutorial worked with this.  

* Build your container image and push to the Docker hub. Run it and show me a screen shot. 

* Push your newly configured system back up to Github. 

* EXTRA CREDIT: Figure out how to automatically deploy your container to your new VM via an appropriate Terraform operation. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance#from-container-image; you will need to research how to do this via a Terraform template. 


== A basic main.tf file

* Using the below code as a basis, you can create a simple Terraform file (`main.tf`) to create a container-optimized VM. 
* Reminder: To run Terraform, save this file in a directory, changing variables as appropriate, and run `terraform init` and then `terraform apply`.
