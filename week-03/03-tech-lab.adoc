= Lab 03 (Technical) Deploying an application with Docker

_This is still an early stage lab. All that is required is that you do your best and present errors to the instructor and your classmates._

Learning objectives for this lab:

* Gain basic Docker skills using GCP
** Running pre-existing Docker containers
** Creating a Docker container with a simple application in it
* Moving your application to Docker

== Priority #1: Destroy all Google VMs. 
You should never leave anything running on Google. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/compute and make sure all VMs are destroyed, manually if necessary. 

Get in the habit of running `terraform destroy -auto-approve` at the end of every session. You only should be creating VMs (and networks, firewalls, etc) via Terraform templates. 

== Basic Docker skills

* Study https://cloud.google.com/containers/.

* Run https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-docker[Quickstart for Docker^]
** You do *not* need to run and initialize the Cloud SDK unless you intend to operate Google Cloud from your personal laptop. It is already installed on the Google Cloud Shell. 
** That tutorial only *creates* the container, and builds an image and uploads the image to the Google Container Registry. To *run* it, type: `docker run gcr.io/<your project ID>/quickstart-image` and view the results; you should see something like this:

....
betz4871:docker-tutorial$ docker run gcr.io/proven-sum-252123/quickstart-image
Hello, world! The time is Thu Mar 12 23:31:41 UTC 2020.
betz4871:docker-tutorial$
....

** You have now created and run your first Docker container. 

* Now, run the Docker tutorial https://docker-curriculum.com/  ONLY up to the *Docker on AWS* section. In particular, *you do not need to install Docker.* We will not use your local computer, or Amazon as indicated. Use the Google Command Shell natively to complete the first part of this lab. It already has Docker fully installed, including busybox. 

** Note that you will need to be intelligent and make adaptations while you run the tutorial, even if it is somewhat imprecise when you should do so. For example, the tutorial suggests you execute `$ docker rm 305297d7a235 ff0a5c3750b9`, but those will not be the right container IDs for you (almost certainly -- they aren't for me, as I walk through it). 
** However, the command `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)` does *not* need any adaptation. We like commands like this. 
** The tutorial suggests: "You can open http://localhost:32769 in your browser." However, this does work. Why not? What would you have to be doing in order for this to work? Try `curl` instead. 
** Even better than curl: at the top left of the Google Cloud Shell you will see the following icon: image:GCSWebPreviewIcon.png[]. 
*** If you click on this icon you will HTTP preview whatever the current localhost context is (if you are in the Google Command Shell and running a process there, it will preview that; if you are in a VM, it will preview what the VM is running.)
*** It offers you some ports: 

image:GCSWebPreviewPortSelect.png[]

*** You change the port your container serves on through the -p flag on Docker Run. For example, `docker run -d -p 8080:80 -P --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site`
** The tutorial is a little strange in that it tells you to make a Dockerfile. But you pull down a Dockerfile (it's in the flask-app subdirectory) so it's pointless to create it. But you should open it in nano. 
** Note that you do the docker build in the flask-app directory.
** If you get a "cannot remove running container" error, use `docker kill`, e.g. `docker kill static-site` or `docker kill <instance_name>`. To see your instance name, use docker ps. The last column will have two random words separated by an underscore. 

** We are using Google, not Amazon. Stop where it says "Docker on AWS." 

== More

** Create your own instance using `cos-cloud/cos-stable` and `fi-micro` and the `main.tf` file suggested below. Using what you have learned so far, log into the new VM and run your container from the Docker Hub. 

** Try pinging your new VM from a local command prompt. Are you able to do this right away? 

** Try accessing your website as the tutorial suggests. What issues might you be having with the address? Why? 

** Does the website seem to hang? Don't be impatient. Time how long it takes to display. 

** How might we make it faster? Think about this. (In class discussion.)

** Be sure to destroy. 

== Replatforming your system

* On your Github account, set up an empty repo with the name "YOUREMAIL-dock-tut" (YOUREMAIL is your 8 char email account), and clone it down to your ~/repos directory on Google Cloud Shell. 

* Configure a basic static webserver of your choice (e.g. based on the webfsd example)

* Move your images and html file over to your new repo. 

* Create an appropriate Dockerfile. Is the `ONBUILD` trigger useful? Review how the tutorial worked with this.  

* Build your container image and push to the Docker hub. Run it and show me a screen shot. 

* Push your newly configured system back up to Github. 

* EXTRA CREDIT: Figure out how to automatically deploy your container to your new VM via an appropriate Terraform operation. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance#from-container-image; you will need to research how to do this via a Terraform template. 


== A basic main.tf file

* Using the below code as a basis, you can create a simple Terraform file (`main.tf`) to create a container-optimized VM. 
* Reminder: To run Terraform, save this file in a directory, changing variables as appropriate, and run `terraform init` and then `terraform apply`. 

....
provider "google" {
  project = "INSERT YOUR PROJECT NAME HERE"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}
resource "google_compute_instance" "dock-tut" {
  name         = "dock-tut"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"
  zone         = "us-central1-c"
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "cos-cloud/cos-stable"
    }
  }
  network_interface {
    network = "default"
    access_config {
      // Ephemeral IP
    }
  }
}
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default" {
 name    = "dock-net"
 network = "default"

 allow {
    protocol = "icmp"
  }

  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["22", "80", "8080", "1000-2000"]
  }
}

  output "ip" {
     value = "${google_compute_instance.dock-tut.network_interface.0.access_config.0.nat_ip}"
  }
