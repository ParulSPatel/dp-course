== Looking forward to next week
The next goals for the class - feel free to get started, here they are high level: 

* Replatform from webfsd to Node.js, rewriting your Terraformed repo appropriately. 

* Run a Docker tutorial (this would be good to do before class)

* Wrap your replatformed app in a Docker container

== Beyond next week

* Implement some trivial logic in your app, exposed as an API (add 2 numbers, concatenate 2 strings, etc.)

* Implement a CD pipeline that builds and tests your application on a "dev" VM and deploys to a "prod" VM.  

* Deploy the class microservices to a Kubernetes cluster

* Proxies, service mesh, monitoring, Open  Telemetry. 

* Incident management 

* Portfolio management

* Organization

* Security

* Information 

* Architecture
