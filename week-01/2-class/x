=== Creating a virtual machine (VM) MOVE THIS TO Lab 01 - run Linux tutorial in Google Cloud Shell

Now, you will create your VM.

You can create as many VMs as you want, but keep in mind that your account will be charged for each moment a VM is online. Note that you should never put your personal credit card information into Google Compute Engine. This is 100% free for you.

The reason we’re using a micro-instance is that it is free to your account, as long as you don’t send/receive too much data. More info here on that: http://cloud.google.com/free. We won’t be needing any amount of power behind the scenes, unless if you need it for your term project.

First, click the options menu (3 horizontal lines) on the top left and then click Compute Engine. This will take a while.

When the "Create" button is enabled, click it:

Leave the defaults, except select the f1-micro type:

Click Create (scroll down). VM instance creation will take a few minutes.

So now that's the instance is running (green check), open the instance by clicking its name and looking at the details and monitoring tabs.

=== Remote Access
It is now time to SSH into your server. Google Cloud makes this ridiculously easy to do in the browser. Go back to the VM instances page and click the SSH button.

This will pop open an SSH window, similar to this:

Yay! You are now in your Linux virtual machine.
