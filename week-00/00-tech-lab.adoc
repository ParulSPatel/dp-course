= SEIS664 Lab 00

NOTE: We are in a bootstrapping phase. We need to get you set up on Github and Google Cloud so that you can learn Linux. But that means you need to execute some Linux without knowing much about it. Do your best to follow the instructions. 

Objectives of this lab: 

- Set up Slack
- Set up Google Compute Engine
- Explore the Google Cloud Shell
- Set up Github 
- Learn basic git commands, using this course as your first repository
- Start the Linux tutorial (you may finish it in the week to come)

== A note on accounts
By the time you are done with this lab, you will have: 

* A St. Thomas email account (actually, you came in with this)
* A Slack account, that should have the same name as your St. Thomas email but will have a different password
* A Github account, that should *not* have the same name as your St. Thomas email. You will configure this with public/private key authentication. 
* A Google account, for running Google Compute Engine

This is FOUR different passwords, as well as a public/private key pair, with a passphrase, for Github. It's your responsibility to keep these accounts straight and NOT get confused which has what password. I recommend the use of a password keeper such as 1Pasword or LastPass. 

== Setting up Slack

* Slack will be the main communication channel.
* I strongly prefer questions be posted in Slack rather than via calling me over. Leverage your classmates for support. 
* Navigate to https://seis664.slack.com/[https://seis664.slack.com/].
** Click "create an account" and remember your password. You should use your St. Thomas email. Whether you use it or another email, you will need a SEPARATE and DISTINCT password from any other Slack accounts you have. This is just how Slack works; you have to maintain multiple accounts. It can be painful.
** Confirm you can read messages. Try posting to the https://seis664.slack.com/messages/general/[#general] thread.
** The channels are not cleared from the previous semester. Have a look, you'll get a feel for the class. 
** To find a channel, click on Channels and it will say "Browse All Channels"

== Accessing Google Compute Engine

For this lab we are going to work with Google Cloud and investigate the Cloud Console.

As this is your first lab, please read these instructions carefully and follow along. It may be difficult or nearly impossible to start over if you make certain key mistakes. 

=== Account Setup

IMPORTANT: YOU MUST HAVE A PERSONAL GMAIL ACCOUNT. FURTHERMORE, YOU MUST USE CHROME. Sign into your GMail using Chrome only. IF YOU USE YOUR SCHOOL EMAIL, OR A DIFFERENT BROWSER, THIS WILL NOT ONLY NOT WORK, BUT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH THE LAB. Go to https://mail.google.com if you don't have a personal GMail account yet. 

In the Canvas announcements there is a copy of an email from Google. Click the "Student Coupon Retrieval Link" to redeem and then read the following very carefully.

You will get the following:

image::images/GCP-student-webform.png[]

Your *St. Thomas email* (NOT your Gmail account) is required for the first form, this is where you will get the coupon (Google requires a valid student account with a university or college). 

Fill in your name and email. You'll get an email like this: 

image::images/eml-verify.png[]

Click on the link in the email and you should see this:

Finally you will get this email with your code:

(Do NOT use the code in the image above. Use the code you got in your email.)

Click the link "[here]" under the code, then you will see the following page:

You should be dumped to a screen that looks like this:

image::images/billing-acct.png[]

This is the Billing page. It tells you how much money you have in your account. All of your Projects will be linked to this billing account. This is how cloud computing works.

=== Exploring the Google Cloud Shell

We increasingly avoid any dependence on the computers in this classroom. Instead, we rely on the Google Cloud Shell, which is a specialized VM, as discussed in class. It offers a terminal emulator available in the Chrome browser when you sign into the Google Compute Engine. 

Review 

* https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/features. 


=== Linux Tutorial

IMPORTANT: A note on running tutorials. We rely on other people's tutorials in this class. Sometimes you have to interpret them a bit; this is an important skill to practice. Feel free to raise issues on Slack if a tutorial "doesn't make sense."

Now that you have access to the Google Cloud shell, run this Linux tutorial. 

https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/

It's fine if you work on this during the week, but *you need to have it completed by next week.* The quiz will cover it, so do not take the quiz until you are done with the tutorial. 


== Setting up Github account
=== Getting started

Go to http://github.com and set up a user account (one per individual, even if you are in teams). You do NOT want to use your school email account name for this, as your Github account may be an asset throughout your career. *Choose a suitably professional user name that you can use for the rest of your professional career.* 

Set up a private/public key pair for your Github credentials in the Google Cloud Shell. Start by going to Git Bash under your Windows menu.

Next, review these instructions: 

https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

https://help.github.com/en/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection

and follow them. 

Autoconfigure your Git Bash to launch the ssh-agent every time: 

https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases

You can create a .profile file using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). 

Close and re-open Git Bash. 

Now, run this tutorial:

=== Clone this repository

A key strategy of this course is that the students contribute to the learning materials ongoing. This is essential, because the industry changes too quickly for instructors to keep up with extensive updates to materials.

Therefore, these instructions you are reading right now are something that we all collaborate on. You need to know how to change the instructions to help correct errors or add insights you may have developed as you work through them. 

When you have finished configuring your Github access and tutorials, download this repo to your computer. Open Git Bash and type: 

`cd`

`mkdir repos`

`cd repos`

`git clone git@github.com:dm-academy/aitm-labs.git`

Now, you should have all the lab files locally on your machine. You can open them in VSCode or other text editor. In this way you can change them and submit changes back to the central repo as pull requests. 

REQUIRED ASSIGNMENT: Try submitting a minor change as a "pull request" to THIS file (preferably something helpful, but you can propose any kind of change) via the techniques presented in the tutorial. Note that you will not be able to accept the change, as I am the maintainer of this file. I would have to approve. 

IMPORTANT: From this point forward, you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to submit issues and enhancements to the course documentation. Extra credit points are readily available for contributing to the class in this manner. Don't allow yourself to "get stuck." Communicate with your classmates in Slack and if you are still stuck then raise a Github issue. If you are stuck, the problem is in the instructions, and we need to fix it.
