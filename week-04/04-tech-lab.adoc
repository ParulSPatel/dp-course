==  Upping our Git collaboration

Important: To continue with Git, you MUST have ssh configured. If you are still typing in a username and password, you must go back to lab 00 and complete the ssh section. Note that this section was enhanced since week 00. Do NOT do anything else until you have successfully set up ssh. 

IMPORTANT: Because (fall 2020) many of you did not complete configuring ssh for github, I am requiring that you upload the output of this command: 

`$ ssh -T git@github.com`

You may see a warning like this:

[source,bash]
----
The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
----

or like this:

[source,bash]
----
The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
----

Verify that the fingerprint in the message you see matches one of the messages in step 2, then type yes:

[source,bash]
----
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

----

Verify that the resulting message contains your username. If you receive a "permission denied" message, see https://github.com/dm-academy/dp-course/blob/master/faq.adoc[the FAQ] or https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/error-permission-denied-publickey[this Github advice].

Again, take a screenshot and add to the Lab 04 assignment submission. 

=== Re-cloning, NOT as a template

NOTE: I thought the Github template functionality would be more efficient, as it does not include history. But this causes more issues than it solves. So, for Fall 2020 *only*, we need to archive our working repositories and re-clone, NOT as templates.

To fix this: 

You should have two repositories at this point, a copy of dp-course (the course repo, what you are reading right now) and a copy of node-svc that you forked from a template and renamed using your St. Thomas ID. 

The copy of node-svc is the problem. It doesn't share a history with node-svc which means it's hard to sync them up. 

You may have some useful work in your existing repository, so we want to save it locally but delete it on Github. So, 

* Leave it in your local `repos` directory on the Google Cloud Shell as named
* But on Github, go to your account and go into the repository <my St Thomas ID>-SEIS664 (or whatever you called it), go into its Settings, scroll all the way down, and *delete* it. You will have to re-type the repository name and re-enter your password. 
* Then, go to https://github.com/dm-academy/node-svc and fork it (there is no longer a template option). From your forked copy on github, choose the URL and git clone to your local `repos` directory on Google Cloud Shell.

=== Setting upstream remote

Up until now, we have been somewhat haphazard and basic with our usage of git and Github, just as a startup with a couple of individuals might be -- primarily using it as a repository/archive, but not very effectively as a collaboration tool. 

In particular we have been using this basic approach: 

image:../week-00/images/github-arch.png[]

The problem with this approach is that there is no convenient way to pull updates from upstream into our local repo. 

There are two ways we can solve this. 

1. I could make you all members of my Github project. This is too much administration for me every semester. 
2. We can continue to have you fork and then clone (as you would if you were participating in an open source project for which you were not yet a committer) but set things up so that you can do it all from the command line. 

We will go with option #2. 

In order to proceed with #2, we need to better understand the concept of a git "remote." Git is a powerful tool for distributed collaboration on complex software projects, and therefore itself is complex. 

According to https://www.git-tower.com/, "A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server."

What this does not mention is that a git repository can have _multiple_ remotes. Your local clone on the Google Cloud Shell has, as a remote, the fork you created in Github. This is its origin.  Now, you are going to set as your _upstream_ remote the original source repository you cloned from as a template. 

(This lab is based on these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork.)

So, let's configure remotes for both node-svc and dp-course. 

Go to your `repos` directory (or wherever you have put the repos). Enter (`cd`) into the node-svc repo, if you aren't there already from the last step. 

At the command prompt, enter: 

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/dm-academy/node-svc`

This adds the original repo as the `upstream` remote. You still have the `origin remote`, under _your_ GitHub account. 

I have done so using a test Github account called CharlesTBetz-test. I can see the result thus: 

[source,bash]
----
betz4871:node-svc$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:CharlesTBetz-test/node-svc.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:CharlesTBetz-test/node-svc.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/dm-academy/node-svc (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/dm-academy/node-svc (push)
betz4871:node-svc$
----

Notice there is both an `origin` and `upstream` remote. Examine the URLs for each. One points to the dm-academy master repo, the other points to its forked replica on my test account. 

Let's synch things up: 

`git pull upstream master`

Unless you have changed your local copy, or upstream has changed since you forked and cloned, this should indicate that everything is up to date. 

The overall architecture now looks like this (notice 6 and 7):

image:images/Github-v2.png[]

Now, go to your dp-course repo and do the same thing. 

From now on, before pushing any changes and especially before issuing a pull request, be sure to synch your local copy with upstream. 

IMPORTANT: It is convenient to sync your online git repo with upstream by just pushing the changes from your local repo (7 + 4). You also can compare across upstream and your fork and merge changes directly on Github (8 + 5).

== Github issues, branches, and pull requests




== Taking stock


One of the major focuses of this lab will be to 

- Taking a break from the technicalities
-- (You can catch up now)
- Take stock of the product and its needs
- Documenting a vision
- Develop a backlog
- Hypothesis testing
- Feature flags?
